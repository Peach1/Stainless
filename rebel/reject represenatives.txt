If you see a poor person being oppressed by the powerful and justice being miscarried throughout the land, don't be surprised! For every official is under orders from higher up, and matters of justice only get lost in red tape and bureaucracy. Ecclesiastes 5:8

...When you protest 2000 years ahead of time:

Even the king milks the land for his own profit!
Those who love money will never have enough. How absurd to think that wealth brings true happiness!
The more you have, the more people come to help you spend it. So what is the advantage of wealth-- except perhaps to watch it run through your fingers!
People who work hard sleep well, whether they eat little or much.
But the rich are always worrying and seldom get a good night's sleep.

There is another serious problem I have seen in the world. Riches are sometimes hoarded to the harm of the saver,
or they are put into risky investments that turn sour, and everything is lost. In the end, there is nothing left to pass on to one's children.
People who live only for wealth come to the end of their lives as naked and empty-handed as on the day they were born.

Ecclesiastes 5:9-15
